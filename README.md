# ESP32-2-Player-Memory-Game

• Developed a multiplayer memory matching game on two ESP-32 micro-controllers, leveraging ESP-NOW for
ultra-low latency communication, achieving less than 1% lag between devices to create a seamless experience.
• Engineered game mechanics, including player health, randomized patterns, scoring, and a bomb feature in C++,
with real-time state synchronization across devices to enhance player experience.
• Designed and implemented a robust communication protocol using ESP-NOW to securely handle and transmit game
states, ensuring accurate updates for player scores and health metrics.
